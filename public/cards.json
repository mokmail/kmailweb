Given a prompt or query, RAG retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of text, such as PDF documents, and uses this information to generate a response. The model then generates text based on the retrieved information, allowing for more accurate and informative responses. RAG has applications in various areas, including question answering, text summarization, and document-based dialogue systems",

It retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of text and then uses that information to generate human-like responses. To create a tool that can chat with a YouTube video using RAG  we'd need a system that can: Transcribe the YouTube video: Convert the audio or video content into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) or video-to-text technology. Retrieve relevant information: Use a retrieval model to gather relevant information from a large corpus of text related to the video's content. ",
